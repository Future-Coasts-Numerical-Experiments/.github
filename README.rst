Future Coasts Numerical Experiments Organisation
=====================================================

This is a landing point for the Future Coasts Numerical Experiments. This github organisation has been set up to keep track of and enable collaboration on the numerous numerical expirements for `the Future Coasts Endevour Project <https://niwa.co.nz/natural-hazards/research-projects/future-coasts-aotearoa>`_

Need access to the organisation: Contact Matt Dumont (Matt@komanawa.com) or other users

General Rules Regulations and Repo dos/donts:
=================================================

- Be Kind
- Ask before doing something that can't be undone
- Talk to the repo god before jumping into a repo
- All new repos should have a README.rst document at the highest level which documents:

  - The repo god (e.g. who's leading the charge with the repo) and their contact details
  - Commit to main True/False
  - Documentation or links to documentation for any code environments
  - any other key info about the project.

Privacy
======================

**TODO** Question on privacy, I have currently set up the wiki repo as private, but does anyone have any objections to me making it public?  Similar question for any other repos we develop.

Structure
==============

Wiki
------------

This landing page is public and is not going to be used for the collaborative wiki.  

**Instead please use the WIKI REPO** **todo**

Github can automatically render RST and markdown.  I would suggest we use ReStructured Text.  While it's a litle more complicated than markdown it makes handling images **MUCH** easier.  I have included a how to use RST page in the wiki repo: [#todolink]. If you have questions on how to use RST please let me know, but there is a substantial amount of available documentation -- please read it before you hassle me!

The wiki repo is expected to contain documentation, but it is also considered appropriate to link to documentation within an experiment repo.

Indidivual expriments
-------------------------

Generally experiments/work streams should exist in their own repos (unless there is a compelling reason to include them in an existing repo).
